 # Lotus Clock: a box breathing timer.
 
 ## The world is worried. 🥺
 
 Just in 2017, globally, **10.7% (792 million) of our population suffer mental health disorders**, with the highest being:
 * _anxiety_ (3.4%, 264 million) and
 * _depression_ (3.8%, 284 million).
 
 Although stress and all that can be part of our lives, we can solve them!
 
 ## Box breathing: one way to calm the storm. 🌬
 
 Box breathing is a simple, slow & deep breathing technique, developed by Navy SEALs to maintain calm during their combat training/condition.
 
 ### Medical benefits 💖
 
 * Better physical/work performance, mental clarity, and decision-making;
 * Better sense of control;
 * Improve mood, reduce _stress_ and even serious _anxiety/panic disorders_; and
 * Reduce insomnia during bedtime.
 
 ### How to do it? How long? ⏱
 
 1 full cycle = Inhale 4 secs, hold breath 4 secs, exhale 4 secs, hold breath 4 secs. Use your full lung capacity while inhaling and exhaling.
 
 Beginners should start with one minute or more. And do it daily, once or more. Quick, right?
 
 Since 1 cycle = 16 seconds, 60 seconds leaves incomplete 4 cycles... 16 secs + 16 secs + 16 secs + 12 secs?!
 
 So, you need: 4 cycles x 16 seconds per full cycle = **64 seconds**.
 
 * Note:
 You might feel uneasy at first, but no worries: once you get used to it, the breathing feels better and you can increase the minutes.  😊
