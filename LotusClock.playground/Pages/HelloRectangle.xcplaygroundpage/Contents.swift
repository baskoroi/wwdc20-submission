# Hello, Rectangle!

 If you notice the lotus clock, it's a square-like, with some rounded corners. In SwiftUI, we call this a `RoundedRectangle`. So we'll make one, right above the Hello text!
 
 One catch: A `Text` is a view. A `RoundedRectangle` view. SwiftUI can't contain two views or more at the same time inside `var body: some View {...}`.
 
So a trick to get them shown is by grouping them views, or _stacking_: use `HStack` (stack left to right), `VStack` (top to bottom), or `ZStack` (front to back). This way, SwiftUI thinks you only have _one_ `View` to show.

## Goal
* Callout(Stack 'em all!):
  * Show a rectangle, i.e. `RoundedRectangle`, above the Hello text.
  * Set the `cornerRadius` first! The higher it is, the bigger the rounded curve; the lower, the smaller.
