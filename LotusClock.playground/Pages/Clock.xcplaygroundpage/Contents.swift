# May the clock breathe! ëÅç

The moment you've been waiting for: our __lotus clock__.

We provide here:
 
* `BreathingClock` object in `ContentView`, to count the cycles/steps;
* `LotusView`, to animate the lotus clock; and
* The `Combine` library, for our `BreathingClock` to communicate with our `LotusView` and `Text`.

## Goal
 
* Callout(The final countdown...):
  * Run to ensure the clock is running well.
 
 For first try: don't wait for 4 cycles. No need to breathe along.
 
 Now what matters is, whether the lotus clock animates... üòâ
