# May the clock breathe! ëÅç

We have provided here:
 
* `BreathingClock` object in `ContentView`, to count the cycles/steps;
* `LotusView`, to animate the lotus clock; and
* The `Combine` library, for our `BreathingClock` to communicate with our `LotusView` and `Text`.

## Goal
 
* Callout(The final countdown...):
  * Run to ensure the clock is running well.
 
 For first try: don't wait this clock to animate for 4 cycles. No need to breathe along.
 
 Now what matters is, whether the lotus clock animates... üòâ After that, just go to the next page!
