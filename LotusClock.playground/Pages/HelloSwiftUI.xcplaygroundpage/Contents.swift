 # Hello, SwiftUI! üê¶
 
 SwiftUI is Apple's newest tool to create user interfaces on all their devices: iPhone, iPad, Mac devices, Apple Watch, and even Apple TV.
 
 The cool thing is: you can write much less code that is _natively_ supported by above gadgets!
 
 This is your bare-bones SwiftUI code. We'll start from this. Click the Play button on the left-side line numbers below to run, or simply put your text pointer down there.
 
 ## Goal
 * Callout(Type, type, type!):
   Type one example message or gibberish inside `Text(...)`, and run it to see what you type.
 */
import SwiftUI

// the barebones code
struct ContentView: View {   // your view name
    var body: some View {    // the main contents themselves
        
        // GO: type one text inside the double quotes
        Text("")
        
    }
}

PlaygroundPage.current.setLiveView(ContentView())
// GO: put your text pointer here, press Shift+Enter to run
