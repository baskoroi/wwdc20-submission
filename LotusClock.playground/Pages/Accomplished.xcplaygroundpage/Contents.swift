 ## #boxbreathing 🌎🌍🌏
 
 Sure, Lotus Clock _isn't_ the only box breathing timer. There's a lot out there.
 
 But I built this playground to raise awareness about mental toughness and box breathing.
 
 ### So, how do you _save the world_ with box breathing?

 * Research about box breathing, mental toughness, etc, formally or not.
 * Go share them and the Lotus Clock to your friends, social media, wherever!
 * Regularly do box breathing!
