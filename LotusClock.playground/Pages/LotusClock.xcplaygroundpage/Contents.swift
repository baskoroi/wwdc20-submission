# May the clock breathe! ëÅç

The moment you've been waiting for: our lotus clock.
 
You know what to do: add it and make it run. How? Check the goals below!
 
## Goal

We have provided you:
 * Add `BreathingClock` object into our `ContentView`.
 * `Combine` library imported, to connect our smaller views from `ContentView` with our `BreathingClock` instance (and vice versa!)
 
* Callout(So, all you need to do is...):
  * Set 4 cycles for our lotus clock
  * Run this and make you've got 4 cycles ticking!
  * If it's running well, breathe...
 
 You don't need to complete 4 cycles of breathing. As long as the clock runs, go to next page!
 
## Box breathing recap

 If you see there, we have the inner green area growing and shrinking. Here are the steps for box breathing.
   1. Inhale (inner green area growing)
   2. Hold (inner green area stops growing)
   3. Exhale (outer green area shrinking)
   4. Hold (outer green area shrinking)
