# May the clock breathe!

The moment you've been waiting for: our lotus clock.
 
You know what to do: add it and make it run. How? Check the goals below!
 
## Goal

* Callout(Wee, cycles!):
  * Add `BreathingClock` object into our `ContentView`.
  * Add `LotusView` to display our lotus clock!
  * Make sure it runs. By right, you'll see "<number from 1-8> cycles to go!" and then "Finished!"
  * Rest with the timer: breathe for 8 cycles 👏🏼
