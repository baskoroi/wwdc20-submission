/*:
 [Previous: Hello (again), rectangle!](@previous)
 
 # Shrink the giant! ðŸ¦•
 
 Modifiers change how a View looks and behaves.
 
 To shrink the rounded rectangle,  we can set the size for the `RoundedRectangle` using its `.frame(width:height:alignment)` modifier.
 
 `Spacer`s also add space between `View`s. Without them, the Views will look compressed or mispositioned.

 ## Goal
 
 * Callout(Tidy, tidy, tidy...):
   * Add `Spacer()`s after the rounded rectangle and Hello text.
   * The rectangle size has been set for you.
