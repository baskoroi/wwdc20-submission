 # Shrink the giant! ðŸ¦•
 
 Modifiers change how a View looks and behaves.
 
 To shrink it, `RoundedRectangle` has the  `.frame(width:height:alignment)` modifier. We can use that.
 
 `Spacer`s also add space between `View`s. Without them, the `View`s will look compressed or mispositioned.

 ## Goal
 
 * Callout(Tidy, tidy, tidy...):
   * Add `Spacer()`s after the rounded rectangle and Hello text.
   * The rectangle size and `.frame(...)` modifier has been set for you.
