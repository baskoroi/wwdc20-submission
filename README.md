# Lotus Clock: my WWDC20 submission.

## Vision

I believe that our mental health should be as resolveable as physical health is.

I believe that stress, anxiety, and depression should be treatable, but in a _much simpler_ way than visiting your psychiatrists, enduring social taboo, or reading books.

So what if there is? What if there's this one component, that if tapped and taught to others, could change our lives?

## Mission

It turns out that there is the answer, in our very noses and lungs. And it takes very few minutes: __box breathing__.

Lotus Clock is that box breathing timer you can code in SwiftUI. You can learn and customize it, not just use it.

This breathing technique was previously developed by the Navy SEALs to train their calm and mental toughness in the worst of combats and conditions. It has given benefits in civilian lives, athletes, police, and the military.

## Tools

* Frameworks: SwiftUI, Combine
* Xcode 11.4.1 on macOS Catalina 10.15.4 - this is just an Xcode playground.
